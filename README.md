Steps to Create and Deploy the Portfolio Website
1. Set Up Your Project Folder
Create a new directory for your portfolio project.
Inside this folder, create separate files for each webpage like index.html, about.html, experience.html, etc.
Create a folder for your CSS (styles/) and JavaScript (scripts/) files.
2. Design Your Portfolio Pages
Create basic HTML files for each page: index.html, about.html, experience.html, projects.html, and contact.html.
Each page should contain relevant information about you, your work, and your contact details.
3. Style the Website
Use CSS to create a consistent design across all your pages. Make sure to create a navigation bar so users can easily navigate between different sections of your portfolio.
4. Add Interactivity
Use JavaScript to enhance user interaction, such as form validations, animations, or dynamic content loading.
5. Test Your Website Locally
Open your index.html file in your browser to test the look and functionality of the website.
Ensure all links between pages are working correctly and the website is responsive.
6. Set Up a Netlify Account
Sign up for a free account on Netlify.
Once logged in, go to the Netlify dashboard.
7. Deploy Your Website on Netlify
From the Netlify dashboard, choose to deploy your site either by connecting a Git repository (if using GitHub or GitLab) or by using the drag-and-drop method.
If you’re using the drag-and-drop method, zip your entire project folder (including HTML, CSS, JS, and assets), then upload it to Netlify.
8. Configure Your Domain (Optional)
If you wish to use a custom domain, you can configure it in the Domain Management section of the Netlify dashboard.
Follow Netlify’s instructions for connecting your domain.
9. Maintain and Update Your Portfolio
As you complete new projects or gain more experience, update your portfolio by modifying the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files and redeploying the site on Netlify.
